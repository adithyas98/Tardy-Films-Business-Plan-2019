# Tardy-Films-Business-Plan-2019
Tardy Films was a business idea we pitched in the final round of the business pitch competiton held by Colby College


# Executive Summary
Tardy Films is revolutionizing the business of selling movie tickets to a waning customer base. The service will release tickets at significantly marked down prices at the optimal time in an effort to generate more ticket sales on the theater's behalf. Given the fixed cost nature of running a movie theater, this sort of incremental revenue and profit will significantly increase the revenue of theaters. Our business growth is driven on three major factors: acquiring users, signing on more theaters, and finally selling more tickets to the existing user base.
